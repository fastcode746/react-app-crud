## Problem 

As College Students who dont earn anything yet,we are always usually on a tight monthly budget, Sometimes, we spend more than we can and hence we must keep track of our Income and Expenses.
Moreover, Imagine a scenario in which you go out to eat with friends,and you pay the bill,then you also need a way to keep track of who owes how much to you.

## Our Solution

We propose an Expenses Tracker App which can track your income and expenses by reading your transaction messages, and then show you, in one place your current financial standing.
We also allow the user to add Money Lent and Money Borrowed fields in which we notify the people who have taken money from the user to return the money by sending a Whatsapp Message.
